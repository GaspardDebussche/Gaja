This project are part of the Cognitive Interaction with Robots course, in Master in Artificial Intelligence at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona, Spain.

The goal of this project is to put into practice the development methods for robots interacting with their environment or interacting with a human user. We wanted to create something fun and recreational. In addition, we wanted our solution to have a low manufacturing cost. To carry out our project, we used a reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate the behavior of our robot.

We decided to work on pet robots and more precisely, we built a pet cat whose goal is to imitate the behavior of a cat. Our robot can therefore respond to sentences said by the user. We have used natural language processing methods and in particular sentiment analysis so that our cat can evaluate the positive, interrogative or negative character of the sentences spoken to it and then determine the behaviour it should adopt.
